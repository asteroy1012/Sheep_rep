# Sheep_rep
A counter for counting sheep in a farm going in and out. To accurately tell how many sheep are present inside we use two pir sensors that detect the sheeps coming in and going out. The first sensor is placed near to the exit of the door and the second one is placed behind it. If the first sensor detects first followed by detection in the second we conclude a sheep has entered and if the second one detetcts first then we conclude one sheep has left.
